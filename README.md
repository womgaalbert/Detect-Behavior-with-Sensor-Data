## Detect-Behavior-with-Sensor-Data
This project aims  to analyzing and interpret sensor data in other to identify specific behavioral patterns. Our main goal here is to build relevant structured models that can classify and predict behaviors on the given the provided  sensor readings. 

•	Objective: 
Develop machine learning models that can accurately detect and classify behavioral patterns from time-series sensor data. This can have applications in numerous domains, including healthcare,  (Internet of Things) IoT-based systems  and sports.

•	Techniques:
o	Time-Series Analysis: Extract features from sensor data for meaningful insights.

o	Machine Learning Models: Use algorithms like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

o	Deep Learning Models: Implement architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for sequential data processing.

o	Feature Engineering: Handle missing values, normalize data, and design features that capture temporal dependencies.

o	Ensemble Methods: Combine predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.

•	Dataset: The project provides a dataset containing sensor readings over time. Data includes multiple features recorded from various sensors and corresponding labels indicating behavioral categories.

o	Dataset Link: Kaggle Dataset for Behavior Detection
